# NotebookLM PDF Watermark Remover

A simple and efficient local tool designed specifically to remove footer watermarks from PDF files generated by Google NotebookLM.

It uses an **adaptive background color overlay** approach rather than destructive image erasing, making it extremely fast and preserving the original file layout.

## Key Features

*   **GUI Interface**: Built with CustomTkinter for a modern and beautiful interface.
*   **Smart Color Detection**: Automatically detects the background color around the watermark on each page (whether pure white or beige) for perfect blending.
*   **Batch Processing**: Supports selecting a single file or an entire folder.
    *   In batch mode, creates a `去水印` (Watermark Removed) folder in the same directory to keep the original file structure clean.
*   **Parameter Tuning**: Supports customizing the width, height, and margins of the coverage area.
*   **Debug Mode**: Can enable red border preview of the coverage area for easy position confirmation.
*   **Bilingual Support**: Switch between Chinese and English interface.

## Usage

### Method 1: Run Executable File Directly (Windows)
1. Find `PDF水印去除助手.exe` in the `dist` folder.
2. Double-click to run.
3. Click "Select File" or "Select Folder".
4. Click "Start Processing".
5. Processed files will be saved in the `去水印` folder under the original path.

### Method 2: Run from Source
Requires Python 3.8+ environment.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter pymupdf
   ```

2. **Run Script**:
   ```bash
   python gui_watermark_remover.py
   ```

## Development Build

If you want to package the exe file yourself:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "PDF水印去除助手" gui_watermark_remover.py
```

## Core Principle

PDFs generated by NotebookLM are typically composed of images (similar to PPT exports). This tool uses the PyMuPDF (fitz) library to:
1. Locate the watermark area in the bottom right corner of the page.
2. Read the pixel color near that area as the background color.
3. Draw a borderless rectangle over that area.
